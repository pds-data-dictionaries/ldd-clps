# Introduction
   1. Purpose of this Userâ€™s Guide
   - This User's Guide provides an overview of the CLPS Mission Data Dictionary. It details how to include the dictionary in a PDS4 label, describes the organization of classes and attributes, provides definitions of the classes and attributes, and lists examples of labels that use it. 
   1. Audience
   - This User's Guide should be useful to data providers intending to archive CLPS data with PDS as well as PDS Nodes who are working with these data providers.

# Overview of the CLPS Mission Dictionary

The CLPS Mission Dictionary contains classes, attributes, and rules specific to the CLPS missions and their instruments.

# How to Include the CLPS Mission Dictionary in a PDS4 Label

The dictionary consists of a set of files with names in the form PDS4_CLPS_xxxx_yyyy.ext, where
- xxxx = the PDS4 Information Model version, e.g. 1J00 
- yyyy = the CLPS Mission Dictionary version, e.g. 1000

and the file extensions are

- .csv = A comma-separated value table of dictionary attributes 
- .JSON = The dictionary contents in JSON format 
- .sch = The dictionary "rules" as an XML Schematron file 
- .txt = The report generated when the dictionary was built 
- .xml = The PDS4 label that describes this set of files 
- .xsd = The dictionary contents as an XML schema file

Only the schema and Schematron files are needed for validating a PDS4 label.

The latest version of this dictionary may be found on the PDS web site at https://pds.nasa.gov/datastandards/dictionaries/index-missions.shtml#clps.

The following is an example showing the use of this dictionary in a PDS4 label.

          mission, this may (or may not) include operations into the lunar night.
  - TEST, DEVELOPMENT, and CALIBRATION - The test, development, and calibration mission phase refers to the pre-launch period and consists of data 
          processing software development and testing, and instrument calibration. Some products generated during this phase may not be 
          a part of the final PDS archive but may be used for testing and peer review.
